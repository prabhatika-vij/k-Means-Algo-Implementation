# k-Means-Algo-Implementation
Implemented k-Means algorithm in python from scratch. To demonstrate k-Means algorithm, three groups of data points (each group contains 40,000 points adding up to 1,20,000 points) were generated from a normal distribution with three different centers. At the end, a graph is generated which shows the working of the algorithm.
